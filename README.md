#Multiplayer Space Shooter

##Overview

###General

The game that will be created for Concurrent and Multiplayer Game Programming
is a variation of the original 2D space shooter games developed for arcade.
The premise is that you control a spaceship and can rotate it 360 degrees,
accelarte forwards and shoot missiles in the direction that the spaceship is
in. The goal is to shoot and destroy all other space ships around you, with
each spaceship having a set amount of health and 3 lives. 

The aim of the game is to be the last one standing. At the end of each game
a scoreboard is presented detailing the order in which people died/survived
and how many kills each player got. 

###Multiplayer aspect

The spaceships that the player will be fighting against are player controlled.
This will be achieved through either a LAN setup or a server/client setup, depending
on how the player wants to play the game. 

The game will also feature a lobby where the players can meet and agree to start
a game instance. The lobby will also feature an optional matchmaking system that
will feature selecting players that are local to one another and with a basic
skill based selection system (games won and lost).

###Future features

The game might feature AI spaceships where the AI processing is done on the server
and synced between clients.
